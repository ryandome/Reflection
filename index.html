<h1>Reflection on Computer Science</h1>


<p class="one">
      The hardest thing that I don't fully understand yet is using Javascript in order to draw information from json files. I think my problem with trying to solve these is that I have become accustomed to consistent patterns/methods of using HTML and CSS so I try to use pieces of javascript code that have already worked in order to solve later problems. Also I usually get something to work and then stick with that even though I should really be looking to use a better method.

   I would say that for me the harderst thing I have learned would be how to change the layout of a webpage. Early on I had trouble remembering the differences between inline and block elements. I had trouble with floats and clears in css, though I now know that the clear property tells you what can float beside the element. At first positioning was also difficult, as you have to know properties like: fixed, relative, and absolute.
